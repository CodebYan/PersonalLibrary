                    <p class="book__p">A year ago, I discovered something that completely changed my life: the importance of books. Throughout my life, I had never paid much attention to this rich source of knowledge and learning. I simply didn't see the need to read books, as I thought all the information I needed was available on the internet or other media.</p>
        
                    <p class="book__p">However, after coming into contact with some avid readers, I began to realize the value that books can add to our lives. I learned that with them, it is possible to immerse ourselves in the lives and worldviews of the greatest intellectuals in history, who left their legacies to be read and studied by future generations. I realized that books are a powerful tool for reflection on life, the world, and our choices.</p>
        
                    <p class="book__p">That's when I decided to start reading books regularly. At first, I confess it was a bit difficult, as I was not used to reading large volumes of text, but gradually I got used to it and increasingly realized the richness that books can bring.</p>               
                    
                    <p class="book__p">Today, one year later, I have read various books on a wide range of topics, from philosophy, through motivational reading and good habits, to financial education and global economic issues, not forgetting our programming. Every book I read is a new opportunity for learning and personal growth. I discovered that reading is one of the most enjoyable ways to learn, as it allows us to absorb information in a deeper and more reflective way.</p>
                    
                    <p class="book__p">Furthermore, reading has also helped me develop important skills, such as the ability to concentrate and interpret text. I realized that reading is an activity that makes me feel good, both for my personal development and emotional well-being.</p>
